# **Oncology AI Fact Sheet**

Artificial intelligence (AI) systemsâ€”which consist of an AI algorithm and the contexts in which they are deployed, are increasingly obtaining FDA approval and entering the oncology clinic. To facilitate clinical translation of these AI systems, we created an easily digestible fact sheet specifically for **oncology end-users**. The fact sheet places primary focus on guiding end-user interaction and safe use of the system. Fact sheets are intended to be presented at deployment time or, in cases of automated deployment, at prediction time. 

We have made a user-friendly, fillable template publicly available [here](Onc_AI_FactSheet_Template.pdf). Below, we provide instructions and examples for each field of the Fact Sheet. In addition, brief instructions are also included when you hover over fields in the template pdf.

A note on style: This is not intended to be, nor can be, an exhaustive description of each AI system. Instead, developers should consider the most important information for the **clinical end-user** to understand before using the system. The text should be written in non-technical language wherever possible. There are opportunities to link out to additional information that provides more comprehensive information. 

Our publication describing the fact sheet is available [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2802831).

- Example: *Yes. If the model has <70% confidence in its prediction, it will report "Unable to predict". Otherwise, it will provide its precision.* 
- Example: *No, but the model will only provide a prediction if it has >95% confidence in its prediction.*

- Example: *Yes. The system presents a red-bue color wash overlaid on the Chest CT that shows what part of the image was most important for prediction. Red=most important, blue=least important.*
- Example: *Yees. The system shows the laboratory values more associated with the prediction, scored 0-1. 0=least important, 1=most important.*
